As I sit here in the lovely National Union Building in DC, the folks around me are finishing preparation
for our summit.  Speakers are beginning to arrive.  The podium is ready!   We just have a few last minute links to share, including a livestream link &mdash; maybe you can join us online?

* Our [agenda](https://dtinit.org/docs/feb29summitagenda) has been updated
* Our [speaker bios](/docs/feb29summitspeakers.md) are up
* The [livestream](https://vimeo.com/event/4110723/6b96907ccb)
