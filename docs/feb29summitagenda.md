# Register Today: Data Transfer Summit - Empowerment through Portability 

**February 29, 2024** at the **National Union Building** from 9 am ET to 5 pm ET

At the nexus point of personal data, regulation, and market opportunity, today a paradigm shift is in progress. From the Digital Markets Act in the EU to pending proposals in Korea, the re-introduction of the ACCESS Act in Congress, and new state proposals in the U.S., forthcoming laws together with new tools and technologies for personal data empowerment will lead to new opportunities for the information economy. Delivering the best collective outcomes through this transition will require collaboration and cooperation among many multidisciplinary stakeholders.

DTI will host such a collection of experts and stakeholders on February 29th at **the Data Transfer Summit - Empowerment through Portability.** The daylong summit  will convene expert panels of academics, civil society, and industry on the difficult policy questions surrounding the future of data portability. The event will combine cutting edge research with practical considerations of implementation, surfacing both the challenges and the immense opportunities that lie ahead.

The Data Transfer Summit will feature speakers from leading organizations including **NTIA,** **Google**, **Meta**, **Public Knowledge, Center for Democracy & Technology, Foundation for American Innovation**, and more.

<p><strong class="list-heading">11:00 am - 12:00 pm: <b>The Business Case for Data Portability</b> &mdash; <i>Panel Discussion</i></strong>

Numerous open questions remain about data portability, particularly concerning how various laws should work together and with existing frameworks, and how these obligations and expectations mesh with the real worlds of technology design and business operation. And while there is much more to be done, the industry has made progress over several years to make data portability as simple, efficient, and easy as possible for consumers to use. Today, there is not only a regulatory case to be made for portability, but also a business one. During this panel, industry executives will share their perspectives as businesses in meeting this challenge. </p>

<p><strong class="list-heading">3:30 pm - 4:30 pm: <b>Data Laws, Rights, and Regulations</b> &mdash; Civil Society Panel Discussion</strong>

Regulators around the world recognize data portability as a tool to protect consumers and promote competition in digital markets. In this panel, executives of well-known public interest groups will discuss existing laws and other forces at play currently shaping user empowerment of data. Among questions for exploration include how data portability and interoperability relate to competition and privacy/data protection–as well as structural questions about which entities are best suited to enforce existing laws–and related questions about the FTC, state legislators, federal agencies, and newly introduced proposals for an independent regulator dedicated to these issues. Executives will share their insights about the current state of play, forthcoming challenges, and potential solutions, as well as their thoughts on why this topic is more important than ever to help empower consumers. </p>
