  <h2>Our beliefs about standards</h2>
  <p>
    <strong class="list-heading">Build for users</strong>
    Data portability tools should be easy to find, intuitive to use, and readily available for users.
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong class="list-heading">Privacy and Security</strong>
    Providers on each side of the portability transaction should have strong privacy and security measures—such as encryption in transit—to guard against unauthorized access, diversion of data, or other types of fraud.
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong class="list-heading">Focus on users' data</strong>
    Portability efforts should support and empower the individual user and how they shape their digital presence and activities. The content that a user creates, imports or approves for collection is to many the most obvious kind of data to transfer.  Data generated by user activity can be more challenging to make available in a sensible way that adds value for the user, but some applications may be very compelling.
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong class="list-heading">Respect Everyone</strong>
    We live in a collaborative world: people connect and share on social media, they edit docs together, and they comment on videos, pictures and more. Data portability tools should be respectful of a user's expectations of the context of their contributions.   Careful understanding of use cases and respecting the contributions of all parties involved can inform choices about portability scope.
