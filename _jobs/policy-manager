# Policy Manager

## Background

The Data Transfer Initiative (DTI) is a non-profit tech/policy organization launched in early 2023.  Our mission is to empower people by building a vibrant ecosystem for simple and secure data transfers. Evolving markets and regulations are creating circumstances for significant investments into data portability, supporting increased control and choice for individuals. We collaborate and communicate with our partners (including a growing list of corporate supporters) as well as with regulators, public interest groups, standards organizations and more. We are building, together with our partners, a growing ecosystem of open source software and interconnected portability services. DTI is established in public policy conversations and processes as a leading organization helping to shape the future of data portability and user empowerment.

## Job Description

The Data Transfer Initiative is seeking a policy manager to uplevel our organizational output through significant original analysis and writing. As a mid-level individual contributor, you will wear many hats: you will write original policy briefs and white papers, including those identified by DTI leadership and those you yourself identify as strategic and worthwhile; you will help craft our communications and external-facing voice on policy; and you will network and evangelize for our work with the tech policy community. Topically, the work will focus on data portability and related issues, and will include American and European legal and political contexts, stretching into other jurisdictions as strategic opportunities dictate. This position will be full-time and remote (within the United States), with occasional travel estimated at <10%. This role will report to DTI's Director of Policy; however DTI is a very small team, and regular interaction and collaboration with the entire team is expected.

### Responsibilities

* Help craft and execute on a policy agenda to promote user-centric data transfers, including through written substantive output and advocacy.
* Support and help drive DTI's policy and brand communications efforts by crafting newsletter entries, op-eds, and social media.
* Engage with stakeholders working on data portability and related issues in government, civil society, industry, and academia.
* Occasional travel for meetings and conferences, including public speaking opportunities.
* Stay current with tech policy, politics, and news to identify strategic opportunities to highlight DTI's work.

### Minimum Qualifications

* 6+ years of experience with tech policy and law
* Understanding of tech-related policy issues and political contexts in DC and in the EU
* Ability to explain complex and technical concepts simply to a non-technical audience
* Strong writing skills
* Public speaking, press and stakeholder engagement experience
* Advanced degree in public policy, government or law preferred

## Why work for DTI

* We have a great mission! We believe people should not be locked into the platforms where they have contributed data and content by that data being hard to move elsewhere, and we work to support tech policy and interoperability. Itâ€™s a meaty topic that we get very technical about because we advise on regulations, security policies, threat models and system architecture.
* Within our mission, we have a great deal of flexibility to grab opportunities and consider new projects, as long as we execute competently and iterate wisely. Your ideas will be welcome.
* We have a great deal of flexibility for timing and conditions of work. We care more about good quality work at a decent pace than about hours worked or where. Pacific TZ is core hours for collaborative work.

## More key details

* Compensation: $80-120k USD, depending on experience, Alternative arrangements for full-time equivalent consulting-based work for candidates outside the United States may be considered.
* Benefits: Fully paid medical, dental, vision
* Vacation/sick leave: Unlimited
* Travel: Occasional, including international (estimated <10%)
* Workspace: DTI does not have a physical office; reasonable co-working space costs can be subsidized in some circumstances.
