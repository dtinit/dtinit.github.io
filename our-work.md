## Policy and Trust work

Our work on portability policy means that we talk to many policy-makers.  Much of our focus right now is on trust frameworks.  This [blog post](/blog/2023/11/07/framework-trust) is a good introduction.


## Events


<strong class="list-heading">Spring Policy Event in DC - Empowerment through Portability</strong>

The [Data Transfer Summit &mdash; Empowerment through Portability](/docs/feb29summit.md) event convenes
academics, regulators and industry in DC to discuss difficult policy questions and the future
of data portability policy.

### Past Events

## Data Transfer Project

DTI helps to shepherd the Data Transfer Project.  **The Data Transfer Project was created in 2018** as an open-source industry collaboration with a mission of enabling users to complete simple, fast, and secure data transfers directly between services. Since its creation, the project has built an open framework that powers functionality within [Google Takeout](https://takeout.google.com/takeout/transfer/custom/photos){:target="blank"}, [Facebook’s Transfer your Information](http://facebook.com/tyi){:target="blank"}, and [Apple’s Data and Privacy page](https://privacy.apple.com){:target="blank"}.  DTP can connect to over a dozen additional services.

DTP runs as a server in a data exporter's platform. From there, it makes it easier for the data exporter to offer destinations for porting, exporting or backing up data, even in large volume. In turn this allows people to switch services or try new and innovative products. **Without DTP**, transferring a copy of data from one service to another can be a time consuming process, requiring a user to download a copy of their data to a local device and re-upload it to a new service. This can be particularly challenging for mobile-only users, those with limited bandwidth, and in markets where people pay-as-they-go for data usage. Direct service-to-service portability removes the need for local device storage and transfer -– **enabling users to move their data directly between services**.

As an Open Source project, DTP's code defines a service that can be deployed by data exporters and run in their environment, connected to existing front-end interfaces and backend APIs, to support data portability well.   It also defines extensions that data importers contribute to support transfers into their services.  The Open Source project makes portability easier for these companies by providing standard data formats and mechanisms for managing long-running portability "jobs".  Multiple data importing/exporting platforms have contributed adaptors, such that a service adopting DTP can quickly offer multiple interoperable destinations.

DTP continues to be developed and grow today. Further documentation can be found:
