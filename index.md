## About the Data Transfer Initiative

**The Data Transfer Initiative commits dedicated policy and engineering resources to the promotion of data portability.**

Data portability legislation happens at the EU, in the US (both federal and state level) and in other countries and jurisdictions. Those laws affect technology platforms very broadly since so many data and content platforms and services are likely to have international userbases or to participate in data transfers involving parties in other jurisdictions.  DTI policy staff are following or engaged in many active areas of policy across these jurisdictions.  

Awareness of technical constraints and risks helps to support good policy and ultimately good interoperability.  DTI technical staff work closely with policy staff to analyze solutions and risks and share that analysis via our newsletter and other forums, including directly with policy-makers.

Open Source code can be a powerful tool in demonstrating feasibility, lowering the cost to implement data portability, and increasing the transparency and accountability of complicated processes.  DTI is committed to supporting and contributing to Open Source projects whenever we can identify a great opportunity to add value. 

Data portability continues to be a key element of policy discussions around the world, and **DTI will help translate principle to practice, catalyzing greater user agency and empowerment**.

<blockquote>
<p>Data portability is becoming a requirement globally to give consumers greater control over their own data, and choice about shifting to different services. At the same time, if portability is badly implemented, consumers face significant privacy and security risks. The Data Transfer Project has become the global leader for making data portability a reality for users, and the new Data Transfer Initiative will provide the thought leadership needed to consider the multiple relevant policy goals.</p>
