    <h2> Trust Model</h2>
    <p style="font-weight: bold" > A third-party trust model for direct personal data transfers</p>
    <p>The notion of data portability is in the midst of a paradigm shift. As individual user downloads become complemented by direct transfers of user data between service providers, building trust between these parties becomes paramount. DTI has consulted with stakeholders throughout the ecosystem to offer an initial assessment of that trust building process, and a model for the kinds of questions to ask and evidence to gather. We hope this product, along with continued collaboration amongst us all, can help build trust and thus advance DTI's mission: Empower people by building a vibrant ecosystem for simple and secure data transfers.</p>
