    <h2> Trust Model</h2>
    <p style="font-weight: bold" > A third-party trust model for direct personal data transfers</p>
    <p>The notion of data portability is in the midst of a paradigm shift. The original concept of data portability is a data protection centered, individual user right. It says that users should be able to download personal data they have contributed to services along with data reflecting their activity within services. That use case remains intact. However, with the rise of competing services in the market and new opportunities for businesses to deliver user value through personal data, increasingly data portability also encompasses the direct transfer of personal data associated with a user, at the userâ€™s request, from one service to another. This offers many technical advantages, including avoiding any limitations that might arise from poor connectivity or limited local device storage, and shifts the burden of ensuring the data is useful on the receiving service, towards a shared responsibility, as the Data Transfer Project has demonstrated.  </p>
